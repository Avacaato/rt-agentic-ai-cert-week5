**Welcome to Module 2 of the Agentic AI Developer Certification Program! üöÄ**

Whether you wrapped up Module 1 with a completed project or you're continuing your learning at your own pace ‚Äî we‚Äôre excited to have you here as we kick off the next phase of your journey.

In Module 1, we laid the foundations: you explored how LLMs can be used to build smart assistants, designed multi-step workflows, and implemented powerful retrieval pipelines. Along the way, you picked up prompting techniques, memory management strategies, and system design patterns that turn static chatbots into dynamic assistants.

**Now it‚Äôs time to level up.**

**Module 2** is where we shift from building assistants to building **agents** ‚Äî systems that can reason, use tools, and operate more autonomously. We‚Äôll introduce you to **LangGraph**, dive into **multi-agent architectures**, and show you how to scale your systems with **tools, observability, and design patterns** that are built for real-world complexity.

You‚Äôre not just using LLMs anymore ‚Äî you‚Äôre **engineering intelligence**.

Let‚Äôs begin.

 <h2> About Your Module 2 Project </h2>
 
 Before we dive into this week‚Äôs lessons, we‚Äôre also introducing the [**Module 2 Project**](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/gUPu2RlgjzNy) ‚Äî your capstone for the next four weeks. This project will challenge you to apply everything you learn in Module 2 to build and document a real, agentic system. You'll find a separate publication outlining the requirements, expectations, and submission details.

# üìù What‚Äôs in store this week?

Here‚Äôs how the lessons for **Week 5** are structured:
**Lesson 1**: Learn when to graduate from workflows to agents
**Lesson 2a**: Dive into LangGraph ‚Äî what it is, how it works, and why it matters
**Lesson 2b**: Build your first graph system using LangGraph (no-LLM)
**Lesson 2c**: Build an Agentic system using LangGraph
**Lesson 3**: Add observability with LangSmith
**Lesson 4a**: Use built-in tools and toolkits in LangChain
**Lesson 4b**: Build and register your own custom tools

--DIVIDER--

# üöÄ What will you be able to build?

By the end of this week, you'll have the skills to **move beyond linear task flows** and start building **truly agentic systems**. You‚Äôll understand the building blocks of agent graphs, tool integration, and debugging workflows ‚Äî all with real-world code.

Onward!
